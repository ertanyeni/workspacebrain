## Project: GitHub / python-be

## Workspace Brain

This project is part of the **GitHub** workspace.
Central brain directory: `.brain` -> `/Users/nexor/Documents/GitHub/brain`

**Read these files for workspace-wide context:**
- `.brain/DECISIONS.md` - Architectural decisions
- `.brain/CONTRACTS/` - API contracts between projects
- `.brain/HANDOFFS/` - Work transition documents
- `.brain/RULES/` - Coding standards


## Coding Standards

1. Follow existing code patterns in this project
2. Write clear, self-documenting code
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation when changing APIs

## Before Making Changes

1. Check `.brain/DECISIONS.md` for relevant architectural decisions
2. Review any related contracts in `.brain/CONTRACTS/`
3. Ensure changes align with workspace conventions

## Work Logging (IMPORTANT)

After completing meaningful work (feature, bugfix, refactor), log it:
```bash
wbrain log "Brief description of what was done"
```

Examples:
- `wbrain log "Added user authentication endpoint"`
- `wbrain log "Fixed date parsing bug in reports"`
- `wbrain log "Refactored API client for better error handling"`

This helps track progress and maintain project history.

## Recording Decisions

When making significant architectural decisions, add them to `.brain/DECISIONS.md`:
```bash
wbrain log "DECISION: Use PostgreSQL for user data"
```
