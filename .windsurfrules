Project: python-be

## Workspace Brain

This project is part of the **GitHub** workspace.
Central brain directory: `.brain` -> `/Users/altur/Documents/GitHub/brain`

**Read these files for workspace-wide context:**
- `.brain/DECISIONS.md` - Architectural decisions
- `.brain/CONTRACTS/` - API contracts between projects
- `.brain/HANDOFFS/` - Work transition documents
- `.brain/RULES/` - Coding standards


## MANDATORY: AI Session Logging

**CRITICAL**: You MUST log your work at the END of every session. This enables cross-project AI awareness.

### At Session Start
1. **READ** `.brain/CONTEXT/projects/{project_name}.md` for context specific to this project and related projects only
   - This file only includes activity from projects that interact with this one
   - Saves tokens by excluding unrelated project activity
2. Check for updates that affect this project
3. Note any open questions you might be able to answer

### At Session End (REQUIRED)
After completing meaningful work, log it using:

```bash
wbrain ai-log -p "python-be" -t "{ai_tool}" -s "What was done" \
  -r "Why decisions were made" \
  -f "file1.py,file2.py"
```

Or for detailed logs:
```bash
wbrain ai-log -p "python-be" -t "{ai_tool}" << 'EOF'
## Summary
What was accomplished in this session

## What Was Done
- Task 1
- Task 2

## AI Reasoning
Why certain decisions were made

## Related Projects
- **other-project**: How this affects that project

## Open Questions
- Questions needing human input

## Key Files
- `path/to/file.py`
EOF
```

### Why This Matters
- When you switch to another project, the AI there will read your log
- Cross-project dependencies are automatically tracked
- Your reasoning helps future AI sessions understand context


## Code Generation Guidelines

1. Match existing code style in the project
2. Use established patterns from the codebase
3. Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
4. Check .brain/ directory for workspace-wide context
